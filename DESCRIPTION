Description: Asses the enrichment of already known PWMs (from JASPAR
    and MotifDb) in DNA sequences. The package implements multiple
    algorithms, including fixed-threshold (Z-score) and threshold-free
    (Lognormal normalization and Clover) methods. These can be applied
    to a single sequence (e.g. enhancer of interest) or a group of
    sequences (e.g. a set of ChIP-chip/seq peaks). The output is a
    ranked list of PWMs according to their level of enrichment compared
    to genomic background. Custom sets of PWMs and genomic background
    are also supported.
