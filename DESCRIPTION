Title: PWM enrichment analysis
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Robert Stojnic
Description: Asses the enrichment of already known PWMs (e.g. from
    JASPAR) in DNA sequences. Motif hits in a sequence or DNA region
    are considered together and P-values derived for their joint
    pattern. The package implements multiple algorithms, including
    fixed-threshold (Z-score) and threshold-free (Lognormal
    normalization and Clover) methods. The main goal is to identify a
    set of transcription factors that most likely bind to a single
    sequence, group of sequences, or show significantly different
    binding affinity between two sets of sequences.
